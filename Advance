It may be desired to only run certain tasks and to control which tasks get run from cli.

  tasks:
    - name: Print Memory and CPU Cores 
      debug: 
        msg: "Host {{ ansible_hostname }} has {{ ansible_memtotal_mb }} MB Memory and {{ ansible_processor_cores }} CPU Cores."
      tags:
        - info
        
  $ ansible-playbook add_user.yml -u ansible -b -i ./inventory --tags 'info'
  
Blocks
In order to handle errors in Ansible blocks are often used. The block statement defines the main task to run. 
The rescue statement defines a task that should run if an error is encountered inside the block.

    - block:
        - name: Add a user
          user:
            name: "{{ item }}"
            shell: /bin/bash
            generate_ssh_keys: yes
            state: present
          with_items: "{{ users }}"
          when: item is defined
          notify:
            - 'Configure sudo permission'
      rescue:
        - name: revert user add
          user: 
            name: "{{ item }}" 
            state: absent 
          with_items: "{{ users }}" 
          when: item is defined   
   You can simulate this by adding a new user to my_vars.yml file and running without the -b (become root) option.
     $ ansible-playbook add_user.yml -u ansible -i ./inventory
